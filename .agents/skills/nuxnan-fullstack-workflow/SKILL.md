# Nuxnan Fullstack Workflow

Use this skill to move carefully from user request to verified implementation.

## Steps

1. Read `.agents/rules/project.md`.
2. Classify scope: frontend-only, backend-only, database, or cross-stack.
3. Search for existing implementation before creating new files.
4. Trace the flow:
   - Page/component
   - Store/composable/service
   - API route
   - Controller/request/resource/model
   - Migration or relationship, if needed
5. After meaningful analysis or planning is completed, including plan-only tasks, append a concise note to `.agents/latest-analysis.md` with findings, intended files, decisions, risks, and verification plan.
6. Make the smallest coherent change.
7. Verify with focused checks.
8. Summarize changed files and verification.

## Cross-Stack Contract Checklist

- Field names match between API resources and UI consumers.
- Create/update validation supports the same domain rules.
- Nullable fields are handled in both PHP and TypeScript.
- Filter/sort enum values match.
- Authorization behavior is preserved.
- List endpoints eager-load fields shown in cards/tables.
